# Roadmap

A rough roadmap for math.js.

## Version 1.0

- An expression parser.
- A basic set of functions and constants.
- Data types Number, Complex, Matrix, Unit, String.
- Examples and documentation.
- Extensive testing.

## Version 2.0

- Library has a modular architecture, and is split into separate modules like:
  - mathjs-core
  - mathjs-expression
  - mathjs-unit
  - mathjs-matrix
  - mathjs-complex
  - mathjs-bignumber
  - maybe separate modules mathjs-statistics, mathjs-numeric, etc.
- A basic set of functions covering all common mathematical areas.
- Functions and data types for numeral systems: Bin, Oct, Hex, Dec.
- Support for derived units (like km/h, kg*m/s2, etc).
